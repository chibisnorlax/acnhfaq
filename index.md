## Island Development
### What defines a week and a day in-game?
An in-game week begins on Monday at 5:00 AM, and is when your weekly NPC visitor schedule and Nook’s Cranny items are determined. An in-game day begins at 5:00 AM and ends at 4:59 AM the following day.

### Can I move where buildings are on my island?
Yes! Every building and house can be moved except the airport and Resident Services.

### How do I unlock terraforming?
Complete Project K by raising your island rating to 3 stars. Further information can be found under the “Unlocking Things” section.

### How do I raise my island rating?
Once you upgrade Resident Services and unlock the Project K quest, Isabelle will talk to you about increasing your island’s rating. To see a breakdown of how the island rating system works, read here: https://tinyurl.com/islandrating. In general, the best advice we can give is to listen to Isabelle, as she reviews your island in real time and can provide feedback on the areas you’re lacking. That said, it’s always a good idea to put out lots of furniture (both purchased and crafted) and plant lots of flowers and trees!

### What can secondary (non-Island-Representative) players do?
Secondary residents can do everything that Island Representatives can except story progression and some infrastructure things. They can interact with and complete quests for NPC visitors, upgrade/relocate their house, raise friendship with villagers, buy/sell items, donate critters/art to the museum, terraform, place decorations, invite new villagers from mystery islands or from other players, and donate to construction efforts.

They *cannot* buy bridges or inclines, move buildings, or progress the story (i.e., upgrade Resident Services from a tent to a building, build the campsite, etc). 

### How do I get "X" DIY recipe?
There's a lot of different ways to get DIYs, so it depends on what you're looking for! Here's all the ways you can obtain a DIY:
- Villagers crafting
- NPCs (Celeste, Jack, Pascal, Zipper, Leif, and Cyrus)
- Balloons
- Snowboy
- Self-taught (includes King Tut mask, pitfall seed, trash DIYs, etc.)
- NookStop (purchase with Nook Miles)
You can view [this page](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/DIY_recipes#Lists_of_recipes) to help you search for the specific recipe you may be looking for.

### How long do villagers craft for? How many can craft per day?
Up to 3 villagers can craft per day. The first villager starts crafting when you log into the game for the first time that day, then they rotate every 3 hours. 

### What do I do with duplicate DIYs?
Up to you! Some people save them to trade them to other players, some sell them to Nook's Cranny, and some just toss them.

## Island Life
### What determines the weather on my island?
The weather on your island is determined by your weather *seed*. A seed is a special number generated at the creation of your island that determines a specific pattern. In this case, your weather pattern for the entire game. Weather includes things like shooting stars, rainbows, thunderstorms, etc. If you are interested in finding out what your weather seed is, visit https://wuffs.org/acnh/weather/.

Your weather pattern is permanent and unchanging. This means if you were to see a rainbow at 1 PM on June 1st, 2020, you would always see a rainbow at that time on that day if you were to time travel there. This is helpful to know for [meteor showers/shooting stars](#when-will-i-see-shooting-stars).

### What is the spawn rate of X critter?
For the spawn rates of **ocean fish**, visit https://tinyurl.com/OceanFishSpawn.

For the spawn rates of **river fish**, visit https://tinyurl.com/riverfishspawn.

For the spawn rates of **deep sea creatures**, visit https://tinyurl.com/seafoodspawn.

The spawn rates for **bugs** are a bit more complex to calculate, so we recommend referring to the [data spreadsheet](https://bit.ly/3gWAJDe) and comparing their base values relative to other bugs. 

### When will I see shooting stars?
Shooting stars are dependent on your [weather seed](#what-determines-the-weather-on-my-island). On nights with certain clear weather patterns, you may see shooting stars between 7 PM and 4 AM. There are two types of star showers:
- **Heavy meteor showers:** Usually (but not always!) announced by Isabelle or mentioned by villagers. Heavy showers will bring groups of 5-8 shooting stars roughly every minute or so. These are rare, only occurring on average about 10 times per year. 
- **Light meteor showers:** On light shower nights, you will see only a handful of shooting stars each hour, if that hour has a clear sky. These are more common, occurring on average 5-10 nights per month. 

Both heavy and light meteor showers are locked to the date on which they occur, and will always occur on that date even if you time travel. 

### How do I wish on a star, and what does it do?
To wish on a star: when you see or hear it moving across the sky, stand still, look up with your right analog (joy) stick, and press the “A” button. Make sure you are not holding any tools or other items in your hands. You’ll know that it worked if you hear a tone and see the star glow a little brighter. For each star you wish on, you will find a star fragment on your beach the following day.

Star fragments are a crafting material that can be used in DIY recipes.

<!-- TODO: Revise this question for clarity/correctness. -->
### What's the max amount of star fragments I can get?
1 wish = 1 star fragment. You can also visit other players who have shooting stars and wish on their islands; wishes made on someone else's island will count as personal wishes.

By yourself, you can get a maximum of 20 star fragments. If you invite visitors from other islands (**not** other residents that live on your island), you can get up to 40 star fragments. For every 5 wishes that your visitors make, you get 1 additional star fragment on top of whatever amount you wished for yourself. This means your visitors need to make 100 wishes total to get you an additional 20 frags, for a max total of 40.

### Can I visit other islands for shooting stars and/or Celeste?
Yes! You can wish on shooting stars while visiting another player’s island and the star fragments will appear on your island’s beach the next day. Just like on your own island, each wish you make on another island counts for one star fragment, to a maximum of 20 wishes. Any zodiac fragments you receive will correspond to the date on your island and not the date of the host island.

However, if you visit Celeste on another player’s island, any zodiac DIY you receive will correspond to the date of the host island.  

### I didn’t get all my star fragments the next day! What gives?
Star fragments spawn periodically throughout the day, usually 8-11 at a time. If the next set doesn’t appear after a little while, clear your beaches of shells and other items that may block the spawns and wait a little while longer. 

**Star Fragment Drop Rates From Wishing**
- During your birth month:
  - 70% star fragment
  - 20% zodiac fragment
  - 10% large star fragment
- Other months:
  - 85% star fragment
  - 10% zodiac fragment
  - 5% large star fragment

## Turnips/Stalk Market
### When does Daisy Mae visit?
Once you've built Nook's Cranny, Daisy Mae will visit every Sunday from 5:00 am to 12:00 pm. No NPC or event interrupts her arrival. 

### How does the Stalk Market work?
Daisy Mae’s prices change every time she visits, and you can buy turnips for *90 to 110 bells per turnip*. If you choose to purchase them, you can sell turnips to Nook's Cranny until Saturday (after which they will rot). Nook's Cranny can buy turnips for prices from *9 to 660 bells per turnip*. Nook’s Cranny prices change at 12:00 pm for a total of 2 distinct prices per day. The goal is to sell your turnips for *more* than you spent on them to make millions! 

For further, extensive details about turnips and the stalk market, read here: https://tinyurl.com/acnhturnipdoc

### Stalk Market Tips
- There are varying turnip price patterns, and you can predict the pattern using https://turnipprophet.io/, which uses your prices to predict what future prices might be later in the week.
- If you have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, you can travel to others’ islands for a guaranteed high price. Suggested websites to find high prices: https://turnip.exchange, ACNH Discord Server (https://discord.com/invite/acnh). 
- Don't let your turnips rot! You can't unspoil them, and Nook’s Cranny will only buy rotten turnips for 100 bells and they won't be sold as stacks of 10. Instead, they'll sell as one turnip per stack. Make sure you sell by the following Saturday. Otherwise, they'll spoil Sunday morning at 5:00 AM. 

### How do I time travel for good turnip prices?
Your turnip price pattern resets every time you time travel. If you want to fish out big spike price with TT, follow this method:
1. TT to Tuesday at 11:58 AM and check your price.
2. If the price is not anywhere within the 127-225 range, save and quit. TT back to 11:57 AM, re-login. Repeat this step until the sell price is in that 127-225 range.
3. When the price is within the 127-225 range, wait in game until 12:00 pm, then check the price again.
4. If the price is not high enough, return to Step 1.

### How do I do turnip runs?
Turnip runs are a simple process but can be easily used to make tens of millions of bells. The process requires a **Nintendo Switch Online subscription** and a partner. 

1. One person time travels until they find a high turnip price at Nook’s Cranny (see: “How do I time travel for good turnip prices?”). 
    - Aim for 300+ bell prices—the higher the better.  
2. The other person time travels until they find a low buy price from Daisy Mae. (Simply travel to Sunday, back a day, and forward again until you find your desired price.) 
    - Aim for <95 bells price.
3. Buy a full inventory from Daisy Mae, travel to the Nook’s Cranny and sell. Rinse, repeat, make money!

## Villagers
### Who are villagers?
The AC community commonly refers to animal island residents as 'villagers'. (TODO review if needed - Not to be confused with Special NPCs <link>)

### How many villagers are there in Animal Crossing: New Horizons?
Currently there are 391 villagers in AC:NH.

### How do I get a specific villager?
Unfortunately there’s no 100% guaranteed way to get a specific villager unless you have their Amiibo card or adopt them from someone else’s island. Your other options are to use NMT to find them on mystery islands, or hope they visit your campsite!

### How do I make a villager move out?
Please refer to Yue’s move-out guide here: https://yuexr.github.io/acnh/moveout.html.

### I agreed to let one of my villagers move out today, when can I go 'villager hunting' (or) Why don't I see any villagers in my mystery islands I visit?
The villager progresses to the next step in a move-out sequence every next 5 am. `Villager asks to leave and you say yes > Villager is in boxes > Empty plot > Automatically filled with a villager from your 'move in queue'` https://yuexr.github.io/img/mo/2.png
You MUST have an unsold, empty plot available to invite a villager from another player's island, or to find villagers on mystery islands (and you can only invite *one villager from a mystery island* per day). Note: If someone visited and claimed your villager who was in boxes their house will immediately say 'I moved out', but you will still need to wait until the next day for an empty plot.

### How do I invite a villager from another player's island?
The villager has to be moving out and 'in boxes', if you talk to them they will mention that they are moving out and you'll be shown an option to invite them to live on your island. If you have an open plot, they will mention that they spoke to Tom Nook and are going to move in to your island and show up on your island the next day.

### How do I extend the time window my villager is in boxes (or) How do I extend the duration my plot is empty?
Time travel a few hours but stay within the same day (refer to time traveling section).

### Will my villagers move out without telling me?
No. They always need to ask you for your permission before they move out.

### Can my most recently moved-in villager ask to move out?
No. It is 100% impossible for them to request to move out.

### Does hitting a villager/pushing a villager/talking to a villager until they get the purple squiggly/reporting the villager to Isabelle make them more likely to ask to move out?
No. Anyone claiming that these methods increase the likelihood of villagers asking to move out have been misinformed.

### How do I trade a villager to another player?
Receiving player: Must have an empty, unsold plot. (Note: This cannot be plot 3-6 if the player is in the beginning stages of the game.)

Giving player: Must have the villager of interest in boxes moving *out*. ("In boxes" refers to the day after the villager asks to move out of the island, when their belongings are packed up in cardboard boxes in their home.)

The receiving player visits the giving player's island and speaks to the villager of interest twice, which will prompt the "You should move in" dialogue option. After the villager has spoken to the receiving player's Resident Services, the receiving player's empty plot should say SOLD with the villager's name on it.

Note that villager-for-villager trades happen in the same way, but require both players have an extra empty plot to purchase or require time travel. 

### How often does someone visit my campsite?
Campsite visitors are determined on a percent chance roll, where the chance is based on when your last campsite visitor was. 

| Days Since Last Campsite Visitor | Chance of Campsite Visitor |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1-2                              | 0%                         |
| 3                                | 5%                         |
| 4                                | 10%                        |
| 5                                | 15%                        |
| 6+                               | 20%                        |

Meaning for every day starting the 6th day after your last campsite visitor, there is a 20% chance another campsite visitor will appear. Note that campsite visitors are not date-based, so time traveling to a date that you previously had a camper will not work to spawn another one.

### What are the villager personalities?
There are 8 villager personalities.

| Male   | Female        |
|--------|---------------|
| Smug   | Normal/Sweet  |
| Jock   | Uchi/Sisterly |
| Cranky | Snooty        |
| Lazy   | Peppy         |

Special NPCs do not have personalities, and each villager can only be of one personality. Personality dictates the DIYs a villager crafts, the reactions they teach, the dialogue they can use, and more.

### What is friendship/What are friendship levels?
“Friendship” refers to how close you are with your villagers. Talking to them, gifting them items, and completing quests for them all increases friendship. Villagers also have friendship levels, and when you unlock new levels, you unlock new interactions and quests! For more specific details, visit Yue’s friendship guide, located here: https://yuexr.github.io/acnh/friendship.html.

### What are reactions? 
Each villager personality allows you to unlock reactions—these are the emotion animations your character can display. Unlocking them all takes time, so be patient! The infographic below shows which reactions are unlocked based on which personalities. You need a villager of that personality living on your island to unlock those specific reactions. 

For example, if you have no peppy villager, you cannot learn the aggravation, curiosity, happiness, sleepy, or mischief reactions. You can, however, always move out a villager once you’ve obtained all of their possible reactions!

All personality-based reactions: ![Reaction Infographic](/assets/reactions.png)

As of version 1.5.0, there are two event reactions, **Haunt** and **Scare** which are obtainable by playing the Halloween event. 

### What are Amiibos? Who has an Amiibo? 
Amiibos are Nintendo-produced collectibles that come in the form of cards or figurines and allow players to unlock special features when scanned into games. You can buy them from some online retailers or secondhand. In Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Amiibos allow you to invite villagers onto your island or unlock posters, an in-game item. There are 456 Animal Crossing Amiibo cards, including non-villager NPCs, villagers, and special villagers (such as the Sanrio x Animal Crossing villagers). 

All villagers have Amiibo cards except the following: Raymond, Dom, Sherb, Cyd, Reneigh, Audie, Judy, and Megan. (These 8 were introduced into the franchise in New Horizons, and thus do not have Amiibo cards or figures.) The NPCs Wilbur, Orville, Harvey, Lloid, Flick, C.J., Daisy Mae, Gullivarrr, and Wisp also have no Amiibos. 

Note: Amiibo villagers are in no way different from NMT island villagers. They are the exact same.

### How do I invite a villager to live on my island using their Amiibo?
Once you unlock the campsite (see [here](#building-unlocks) on how to unlock it), visit Resident Services and interact with the Nook Stop. On the initial menu, the option to “Invite \[Amiibo\] Camper" should appear. Select it and touch your Amiibo card to your right joystick. Your villager will appear in your campsite as soon as you close out of the Nook Stop. 

After you speak to them in the campsite, the villager will ask you to craft an item for them, occasionally teaching you a new DIY in the process. Repeat this process 3 times (invite camper, craft requested item) will allow you to ask them to move in on their third visit! The 3 days need not be consecutive. You can also juggle up to 8 in-progress amiibo scan-ins at a time; that is, if you scan in a 9th amiibo villager without completing the previous quests, the game will begin to delete its memory of the earlier camper visits.

### I traded one of my first five villagers with a 'basic' house layout, will they have a proper/default layout on the new island?
Yes. Note: Any furniture, fish/bug you gifted them and **is on their floor** will be reset when they move to a new island.

### Is there any gameplay related benefit to gifting villagers?
Yes, it increases your friendship level with them, for more info and also info on what gifts are 'safe' and won't clutter villagers' house layouts please refer to Yue's gifting guide here - https://yuexr.github.io/acnh/gift.html. <!-- TODO: link friendship section -->

### My villager wears clothing I gifted them, how do I reset it?
- Villagers' gifted clothing can be removed via giving them over 24 wearable clothing items, as 24 is the limit for clothing a villager can hold.
- Hats and accessories each have their own categories and their replacement mechanics are still being researched.
- If you wish to remove a custom design, information relating to that is explained in the
- Note: Villagers may place any gifted item (including tops) in their homes as mannequins in their house.

### My villager placed a furniture item I gifted them (or a mannequin of a clothing I gifted them in their house), how do I remove it?
You cannot remove the furniture/mannequin but you can replace it using this guide https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Iql5J5BXG-SuJvtw_duLZzjIw5myGcFnEL-I3BSR_CE/edit?usp=sharing

### What are gifted vs ungifted villagers during trading and why is it important to let someone who you're trading with know?
- Gifted villagers have been given gifts or wear custom designs displayed on Able's back wall. They tend to be less desirable by other players than ungifted villagers, and they can never be ungifted, only have their gifts replaced.
- Ungifted villagers tend to be *higher value*, completely default villagers—they wear only default outfits and have an untouched house, as if they were found from a mystery island.

### What is the move-in/move-out queue (or) What is the void (or) Where do villagers that automatically fill my empty plots come from?
Every player has two "voids": a Move In Queue (MIQ) and a Move Out Queue (MOQ).
- The MIQ holds 4 villagers that came from other players' MOQ that were transferred when you played online with them. When your empty plot autofills, this is where game pulls those villagers from! They can stay in there indefinitely.
- The MOQ is what is commonly referred to as "the void". It is an invisible space where villagers who move out, but are not adopted, go to live (also indefinitely) until they can be passed into another player's MIQ. The MOQ holds up to 10 villagers.

## NPC Visitors and Special Characters
### How often does X visit? How do I unlock X character?
Yue has put together a fantastic infographic for NPC schedules and their unlock requirements, see below!
![NPC Schedule Infographic](/assets/npcskd.png)

### Tom Nook
- Helps you navigate the tutorial phase of the game, and is the point of contact for construction-related queries.
- If you aren't sure what to do, talk to him and choose "What should I do?" If he doesn't have anything for you today, he may have something for you tomorrow! 

### Timmy and Tommy (The "Nooklings")
- Until [Nook's Cranny](#building-unlocks) is unlocked, you can buy and sell items from Timmy in the Resident Services tent.
- Timmy and Tommy run Nook's Cranny once it's built, where you can purchase decor, plants, and tools.

### Blathers
- Unlocked when you donate 5 critters to Tom Nook during the tutorial.
- Once the [museum](#building-unlocks) is built, you'll be able to donate bugs, fish, sea creatures, and art that Blathers will tell you about as well as display for players to look at. 

### Isabelle
- Unlocked when you upgrade [Resident Services](#building-unlocks) into a building.
- Isabelle handles daily announcements and is the point of contact for resident concerns, island evaluations, and personalizing your island's flag and tune.

These trophies can only be earned once per player. 

The points can also be used to redeem items, of which there are 13. Once you have collected all 13, you will start to receive duplicates. Redeeming points for items (10 points each) does not detract from the trophy total.  

Each bug you catch adds 1 point to your total and each fish after the first three adds a bonus 2 points. The bugs you catch will immediately appear in Flick’s bug cage. He will also buy them from you for 1.5x the regular selling price. If you play with others, you will receive bonus points and waive the 500 bell fee.

You can also give candy to villagers that are outside to get furniture and recipes from the spooky set and lollipops. Villagers will teach you the scare reaction after you give them a piece of candy and likewise, Jack will teach you the haunt reaction. If you don’t have candy when a villager comes up to you, they will give three pieces of candy the first time. But everytime after that or if you don’t give them candy, they will change your bodypaint, eye contact color, and face paint, called a "trick". You can get more candy from villagers that are inside of their house by talking to them while wearing a scary costume. If you wear jack’s outfits while talking to villagers, they will also give you candy. It doesn’t matter if they are outside or inside, but you can only do this once per villager.

## Time Travel
### What is time travel?
Animal Crossing games are based on real time -- for example, things that the game says will take one day truly take one real-life day to complete. "Time traveling" refers to the act of manually changing the time of the game to either be in the future or go back to the past. 

Time traveling is *not* considered hacking. Time traveling also does not reverse/rewind progress. You keep all the progress, items, etc. that you've completed/acquired even if you time travel backwards.

### How do I time travel?
To time travel, you must either close your game or go to the ‘Save Complete’ screen after doing a ‘Save and End’.
You now need to change your date in your Switch settings:	
1. Open System Settings > System > Date and Time.
2. Disable ‘Synchronize Clock via internet’ if it is ON.
3. Go to Date and Time and adjust to whatever time you would like.
4. Return to the game and the new date & time will take effect!

### What are the effects of time traveling *forwards*?
It is important to remember that time traveling forwards is no different than closing your game and then logging in at the new, manually input time. With that said, here are the effects of going forwards.

Negative Effects:
- Cockroaches may appear in your house (1+ month).
- You may get the bedhead animation (1+ month).
- Open plots may fill.
- Turnips will spoil *if* you time travel past the following Sunday.

Neutral Effects:
- Weeds and flowers will grow/spread.
- Villagers may ask/comment on where you have been.

Positive Effects:
- Building construction/upgrades/moves will be completed.
- All stock (Able Sisters, Nook's Cranny, Nook Shopping) will refresh.
- Weeds and flowers will grow/spread.
- Rocks and trees will refresh.
- Mail is delivered.
- Turnip price trend will not change. 

### What are the effects of time traveling *backwards*?
Negative Effects:
- Open plots may fill.
- Turnips will spoil.
- Turnip prices will change and your trend will be reset.
- Watered effect will be removed from flowers and they will not grow/breed.
- Campers will leave.

Neutral Effects:
  - It will not count as a "new day" in terms of progression.
  - Villagers will not advance moving in/out.
  - Building construction/upgrades/moves will not be completed.
  - Shop stock will be the same as it was the first time you visted that day unless you leave the current week.
  - Rocks and trees will not refresh.
  - Mail will not be delivered. 
  
  Positive Effects:
  - The daily recipe bottle will respawn.
  - Fossils will respawn.
  - NPC visitor shops and quests will refresh.
  - ABD chain will remain, and you can claim another daily bonus.

### What happens to my other games when I time travel for AC:NH?
Time traveling for AC:NH will not affect other time-based games unless you launch them whilst the system time is changed.

### Do I have to wait to time travel after someone invites my villager to live on their island?
No, and likewise, you don't have to wait to time travel after inviting someone else's villager to live on your island either.

### Can I time travel to play events that have passed?
Yes! Currently, all past ingame events have **not been locked** and are still accessible with time travel. Future events (ones _nobody_ has experienced) and future seasonal Nook Shopping items are still inaccessible ingame. 

All events (with the exception of Seasonal DIY events, New Year's, Fishing Tournaments, and Bug-Offs) are currently locked to 2020 and will not work in future/past years. The May Day Tour is once per user, but you can still access the event on secondary accounts. 

Player birthdays can only be experienced once every ingame year; TTing back to the same birthday date won't restore it, you'd have to go to a future or past year.

### How do I time travel to farm an NPC visitor?
If the NPC is on a weekday EXCEPT Monday:
 - TT to 4:58am on the same day of NPC. At 5am, it will change to new day and NPC will be there

If the NPC is on a Monday:
 - TT forward a day to Tuesday, then go back to Monday (after 5am)

### Will my villagers move out if I time travel too much? 
Nope! Though this was something that could happen in past installments of the game, villagers in New Horizons will not move out unless you give them explicit permission to do so.

### Will my villagers dislike me/lose friendship points if I time travel too much
Nope! They may have some dialogue about your disappearance if you do a big jump forward, but time traveling has no effect on friendship.

### Do the developers know I time travel? Will they do anything to me about it?
There is actually a variable turned up by data mining called "isTimeSly" that determines whether or not the player has time traveled! With that said, there's no indication whatsoever that the developers care, as there are no permanent in-game consequences or punishments for time traveling. Ultimately, it is your game, and you should play it however you want to! 

## Glitches 
### What is a glitch?
A glitch is an unintended malfunction or irregularity in the game due to bugs in the code. Glitches ***are not***: Bad luck/RNG, unexpected but intended gameplay, or hacked items.

### What is a dupe/dupe glitch?
"Duping" refers to the act of exploiting in-game mechanics to duplicate already existing items. A "dupe" is simply the product of executing a dupe glitch successfully. Duped items are not harmful to the game or the player's save file, as there is no difference between the duped items and regular items.

### What are the current known glitches?

Any previously known glitches, if not contained in this list, **have been patched**. This table is current through vers. 1.5.1.

### Is X a glitch?
The only way to tell if something is a glitch is to see if it is reproducible and if it is unintended. If you suspect you have found a glitch for the **current** version of the game, please contact littlesnorlax#1717 on Discord. As a reminder, Glitches ***are not***: Bad luck/RNG, unexpected but intended gameplay, or hacked items.

### How do I perform the DC dupe? 
The Disconnect Dupe (or "DC dupe") exploits the autosave process to duplicate already-existing items. Please note: **Any interruption of the normal save process could lead to corruption. The authors of this page nor the people supplying instructions will be responsible for what may happen to your game.** With that said, please visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhyHsDs-H3Y for instructions on how to complete the DC dupe.

### What happened to star trees/wrapped critters/Harv's fence/etc.?
A majority of the hacked items have been patched out of the game. The only hacked items that remain are camo items and unobtainable DIY recipe cards (King Tut mask, golden watering can, etc). Bridge and Incline kits can also be picked up, if left unwrapped, but must be used to be removed from inventory. Luna gyroids and mailboxes are left ingame, if owned previously. 

## Miscellaneous
### I heard a rumor that X might be added to the game. Is this true?
If Nintendo has not confirmed the feature/item from said rumor, then we cannot confirm if it will be added or not. However, fun and interesting things surface all the time whilst the dataminers are examining the game's code. Visit http://acnhapi.com/trivia/ for some of this information.

### Is there a list that exists of every in-game item?
Yes! And more! Please visit https://bit.ly/3gWAJDe for a complete list of in-game items, recipes, villagers, and more.
