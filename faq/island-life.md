# Island Life
## What should I do during the first week of the game?
Follow this guide, <https://tinyurl.com/acnhtutorial/>.  

## How can I become friends/best friends with other people? What can they do on my island?
Visit <https://tinyurl.com/acnhfriends>.

## How do I visit other people/invite visitors over?
Starting day 2 of the game, speak with [Orville](/acnhfaq/npc-visitors-and-special-characters#orville-and-wilbur) in the airport and choose "I wanna fly!" to visit someone, or "I want visitors." to open your gates for people to visit you. In order to use the "online play" options, you will need to have an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription. NSO is a paid subscription that you can purchase through the E-Shop that allows you to use the online features of various games, including AC:NH. If you have a friend that is physically close to you (i.e., in the same room or building), you can also choose the "Local Play" option! This option does not require the internet or an NSO subscription, but still allows you to visit other islands. 

## What defines a week and a day in-game?
An in-game week begins on Monday at 5:00 AM, and is when your weekly NPC visitor schedule and Nook’s Cranny items are determined. An in-game day begins at 5:00 AM and ends at 4:59 AM the following day.

## How can I get 8 hits from a rock?
Dig two holes diagonally in one of the corners around the rock. Stand in the corners and hit the rock with a shovel. You should be able to hit the rock 8 times without being knocked away. See below for an example.

## What does eating fruit/turnip/cupcake/candy/lollipop do?
After you eat one, you can dig up a tree or break a rock. If you break a rock, one will respawn per day if there's a place it can spawn. You can get rid of the effect by sitting on a toilet.  

## What determines the weather on my island?
The weather on your island is determined by your weather *seed*. A seed is a special number generated at the creation of your island that determines a specific pattern. In this case, your weather pattern for the entire game. Weather includes things like shooting stars, rainbows, thunderstorms, etc. If you are interested in finding out what your weather seed is, visit <https://wuffs.org/acnh/weather/>.

Your weather pattern is permanent and unchanging. This means if you were to see a rainbow at 1:00 PM on June 1st, 2020, you would always see a rainbow at that time on that day if you were to time travel there. This is helpful to know for [meteor showers/shooting stars](#when-will-i-see-meteor-showers).

## What is the spawn rate of X critter?
For the spawn rates of **ocean fish**, visit <https://tinyurl.com/OceanFishSpawn>.

For the spawn rates of **river fish**, visit <https://tinyurl.com/riverfishspawn>.

For the spawn rates of **deep sea creatures**, visit <https://tinyurl.com/seafoodspawn>.

The spawn rates for **bugs** are a bit more complex to calculate, so we recommend referring to the [data spreadsheet](https://bit.ly/3gWAJDe) and comparing their base values relative to other bugs.

## When will I see meteor showers?
Meteor showers are dependent on your [weather seed](#what-determines-the-weather-on-my-island). On nights with certain clear weather patterns, you may see shooting stars between 7:00 PM and 4:00 AM. There are two types of star showers:
- **Heavy meteor showers:** Usually (but not always!) announced by Isabelle. Villagers will mention it/talk about it if you talk to them. Heavy showers will bring groups of 5-8 shooting stars roughly every minute or so. These are rare, only occurring on average about 10 times per year. 
- **Light meteor showers:** On light shower nights, you will see only a handful of shooting stars each hour. These are more common, occurring on average 5-10 nights per month. 

Both heavy and light meteor showers are locked to the date on which they occur, and will always occur on that date even if you time travel. 

### How do I wish on a star, and what does it do?
To wish on a star: when you see or hear it moving across the sky, stand still, look up with your right joystick, and press the “A” button. Make sure you are not holding any tools or other items in your hands. You’ll know that it worked if you hear a tone and see the star glow a little brighter. For each star you wish on, you will find a star fragment on your beach the following day.

Star fragments are a crafting material that can be used in DIY recipes.

### What's the max amount of star fragments I can get?
1 wish = 1 star fragment. You can also visit other players who have shooting stars and wish on their islands; wishes made on someone else's island will count as personal wishes.

By yourself, you can obtain a maximum of 20 star fragments. If you invite visitors from other islands (**not** other residents that live on your island), you can obtain up to 40 star fragments. For every 5 wishes your visitors make, you will receive 1 additional star fragment on top of the amount you wished for yourself. This means your visitors need to wish 100 times total for you to achieve the additional 20, for a max total of 40 fragments.

### Can I visit other islands for meteor showers and/or Celeste?
Yes! You can wish on shooting stars while visiting another player’s island and the star fragments will appear on your island’s beach the next day. Just like on your own island, each wish you make on another island counts for one star fragment, to a maximum of 20 wishes. Any zodiac fragments you receive will correspond to the date on your island and not the date of the host island. By extension if you had wished on stars on the last zodiac day on your island (or someone else's island), the star fragments you find on the beach the next day will be from the zodiac corresponding to the day you wished.

However, if you visit Celeste on another player’s island, any zodiac DIY you receive will correspond to the date of the host island.  

### I didn’t get all my star fragments the next day! What gives?
Star fragments spawn periodically throughout the day, usually 8-10 at a time. If the next set doesn’t appear after a little while, clear your beaches of shells and other items that may block the spawns and wait a little while longer. 

**Star Fragment Drop Rates From Wishing**
- During the zodiac period of your birth:
  - 70% star fragment
  - 20% zodiac fragment
  - 10% large star fragment
- Other zodiac periods:
  - 85% star fragment
  - 10% zodiac fragment
  - 5% large star fragment

## How can I find X seasonal material?
- See [here](https://bigfootmg.github.io/ACNH-Plant-Guide/07.png) for young spring bamboo, cherry blossom, acorns, pine cones, maple leaves, and mushrooms.  
- Summer shells are found on the beach and more spawn every five minutes.
- Snowflakes flow around you island and can be caught with a net.
- Ornaments drop from decorated cedar trees. They will only appear after Isabelle announces their presence. See [here](/acnhfaq/time-travel#i-time-traveled-to-festive-season-but-why-are-none-of-the-cedar-trees-decorated) for how to get them. 
- Note for acorns, pinecones and ornaments: you can simply shake one tree infinitely until it produces the amount you want.

## How do I build a perfect Snowboy?
It is important to note that size is not the determining factor in how a perfect Snowboy would be, but rather its proportions. The head should be about **10-20% smaller than the body** for it to be considered perfect. The table below shows the correlation of the head to body ratio and its rating.

| Head          | Rating        |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| <60%          | Worst         |
| ~60%          | Not Good      |
| ~70%          | Good          |
| **~80-90%**   | **Perfect**   |
| 100%          | Good          |
| ~110%         | Not Good      |
| >110%         | Worst         |
  
If estimation is not your forte, a general guideline for the perfect Snowboy is to have the top of the Snowboy's body to be the same height as the top of the player's eyes, while the Snowboy's head should be the same height as the bottom of the player's ears. See below for a visual example. Perfect Snowboys reward a Frozen DIY and 1 large snowflake to their builder, and a Frozen DIY to other island residents that speak with them on the day they are built.

![Snowboy Guide](/assets/snowboy_guide.jpg)

### Where can I find snowballs?
From testing (courtesy of *Stoney#9215*), Snowballs will spawn in a **6x6 area of empty grass tiles**, though the area can be smaller or partially occupied depending on what you put there. The first snowball will usually be in the middle of this area, and the second snowball will spawn close by. The second snowball does not seem to be governed by the same spawning rules as the first snowball, as it can appear to spawn on custom designs, in flower/weed fields, as well as paths. 

If you have destroyed your snowballs, entering and exiting a building will usually respawn snowballs. At times it requires the game to be closed before they can respawn.

### Other Snowboy mechanics!
- Only one Snowboy can be built per day.
- If other residents (i.e., residents that did not build the Snowboy) speak to a **perfect** Snowboy on the day they were built, they are also awarded a DIY, or 1 large snowflake if they know all Frozen DIYs.
- If the Snowboy built is the first one ever by the player, the builder will be awarded a Frozen DIY and 1 large snowflake regardless of perfection.
- If the Snowboy is perfect, the builder is rewarded a frozen DIY and 1 large snowflake. However: 
  - If the player speaking to the Snowboy knows all Frozen DIYs prior to building, the Snowboy will only give them 1 large snowflake. 
  - If the builder knows all Frozen DIYs prior to building, ***and*** has crafted one of each DIY, the Snowboy will mail them a crafted Frozen item.
  - For each subsequent day the perfect Snowboy is spoken to by the builder, they will give 1 large snowflake.
- If the Snowboy is **not** perfect, they will not give anything to the builder nor other residents on any day they are present on the island.

***Special Case:*** If a player has at least a tent but hasn't learned how to craft yet, then they'll get mailed the DIY on the first Snowboy. **This is the only way to obtain the recipe cards for trading purposes.** For subsequent perfect Snowboys, the player will only receive 1 large snowflake until they learn to craft.

## What is HHA and what do they do?
After you upgrade to a house, Happy Home Academy (HHA) will begin to evaluate your interior decoration skills every Sunday at 5 AM. Every room in your house will be assessed and you will be given a rank and a score by letter on Sunday. If you reach a certain amount of points, you will also receive a prize in the mail.

### What are the ranks?
Rank Requirements by House Level:
