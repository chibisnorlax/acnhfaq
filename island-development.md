## Island Development
### How long does it take for X to be built?
One [day](/island-life#what-defines-a-week-and-a-day-in-game) after you ask for it to be built.

### Can I move where buildings are on my island?
Yes! Every building and house can be moved except the airport and Resident Services.

### How do I unlock terraforming?
Complete Project K by raising your island rating to 3 stars. Further information can be found under the [Unlocking Things](/unlocking-things) section.

### How do I raise my island rating?
Once you upgrade Resident Services and unlock the Project K quest, Isabelle will talk to you about increasing your island’s rating. To see a breakdown of how the island rating system works, read here: https://tinyurl.com/islandrating. In general, the best advice we can give is to listen to Isabelle, as she reviews your island in real time and can provide feedback on the areas you’re lacking. That said, it’s always a good idea to put out lots of furniture (both purchased and crafted) and plant lots of flowers and trees!

### What can secondary (non-Island-Representative) players do?
Secondary residents can do everything that Island Representatives can except story progression and certain infrastructural decisions. They can interact with and complete quests for NPC visitors, upgrade/relocate their house, raise friendship with villagers, buy/sell items, donate to the museum, terraform, place decorations, invite new villagers from mystery islands or from other players, and donate to construction efforts.

They *cannot* buy bridges or inclines, move buildings, or progress the story (i.e., upgrade Resident Services from a tent to a building, build the campsite, etc). 

### How do I obtain "X" DIY recipe?
- Most recipes are from villagers crafting or message bottles. See [here](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/DIY_recipes) to find which personalities give you which recipes.   
- The Pitfall Seed DIY is either received from a crafting Jock villager or self-taught through digging up a pitfall seed. 
- Most seasonal DIY recipes such cherry blossoms, mushrooms, festive, etc. come from balloons during their respective seasons.

### How long do villagers craft for? How many can craft per day?
Up to 3 villagers can craft per day. The first villager starts crafting when you log into the game for the first time that day; they rotate every 3 hours. Villagers won't craft on event days (e.g. bug-off, fishing tourney, etc.).

### What do I do with duplicate DIYs?
Up to you! Some people save them to trade them to other players, some sell them to Nook's Cranny, and some just toss them.

### How do I farm balloons?
Balloons can be funneled through tall objects, making them much easier to farm as you won't miss any that spawn. To do this, follow the steps outlined below:
1. Find the direction your balloons are coming from. You can do this by looking at the direction smoke is blowing out the top of a house's chimney.
2. Craft or purchase many tall objects. For a list, see here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16E4Dtl0ys5w0W11rU9U-FYvsyiLGTDSNzS50_YyDo40/edit#gid=0
    - We recommend jail bars, as they're wide!
3. Line the coast of your island where the balloons are entering, leaving a space at the bottom for the balloons to come through. If you have a river mouth on that side of your island, that can become the opening as well. You do not need to terraform cliffs for this to work.
4. Sit by your opening and wait. Balloons *can* spawn on the XX:X4 and XX:X9 minutes, with an estimated spawn rate of about 50%. Put on some music and farm those balloons!
