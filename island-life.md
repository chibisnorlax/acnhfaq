## Island Life
### What should I do during the first week of the game?
Follow this guide, https://tinyurl.com/acnhtutorial.  

### How can I become friends/best friends with other people? What can they do on my island?
Visit https://tinyurl.com/acnhfriends.

### How do I visit other people/invite visitors over?
Starting day 2 of the game, speak with [Orville](/npc-visitors-and-special-characters#orville-and-wilbur) in the airport and choose "I wanna fly!" to visit someone, or "I want visitors." to open your gates for people to visit you. In order to use the "online play" options, you will need to have an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription. NSO is a paid subscription that you can purchase through the E-Shop that allows you to use the online features of various games, including AC:NH. If you have a friend that is physically close to you (i.e., in the same room or building), you can also choose the "Local Play" option! This option does not require the internet or an NSO subscription, but still allows you to visit other islands. 

### What defines a week and a day in-game?
An in-game week begins on Monday at 5:00 AM, and is when your weekly NPC visitor schedule and Nook’s Cranny items are determined. An in-game day begins at 5:00 AM and ends at 4:59 AM the following day.

### How can I get 8 hits from a rock?
Dig two holes diagonally in one of the corners around the rock. Stand in the corners and hit the rock with a shovel. You should be able to hit the rock 8 times without being knocked away. See below for an example.

### What does eating fruit/turnip/cupcake/candy/lollipop do?
After you eat one, you can dig up a tree or break a rock. If you break a rock, one will respawn per day if there's a place it can spawn. You can get rid of the effect by sitting on a toilet.  

### What determines the weather on my island?
The weather on your island is determined by your weather *seed*. A seed is a special number generated at the creation of your island that determines a specific pattern. In this case, your weather pattern for the entire game. Weather includes things like shooting stars, rainbows, thunderstorms, etc. If you are interested in finding out what your weather seed is, visit https://wuffs.org/acnh/weather/.

Your weather pattern is permanent and unchanging. This means if you were to see a rainbow at 1:00 PM on June 1st, 2020, you would always see a rainbow at that time on that day if you were to time travel there. This is helpful to know for [meteor showers/shooting stars](#when-will-i-see-shooting-stars).

### What is the spawn rate of X critter?
For the spawn rates of **ocean fish**, visit https://tinyurl.com/OceanFishSpawn.

For the spawn rates of **river fish**, visit https://tinyurl.com/riverfishspawn.

For the spawn rates of **deep sea creatures**, visit https://tinyurl.com/seafoodspawn.

The spawn rates for **bugs** are a bit more complex to calculate, so we recommend referring to the [data spreadsheet](https://bit.ly/3gWAJDe) and comparing their base values relative to other bugs. 

### When will I see shooting stars?
Shooting stars are dependent on your [weather seed](#what-determines-the-weather-on-my-island). On nights with certain clear weather patterns, you may see shooting stars between 7:00 PM and 4:00 AM. There are two types of star showers:
- **Heavy meteor showers:** Usually (but not always!) announced by Isabelle. Villagers will mention it/talk about it if you talk to them. Heavy showers will bring groups of 5-8 shooting stars roughly every minute or so. These are rare, only occurring on average about 10 times per year. 
- **Light meteor showers:** On light shower nights, you will see only a handful of shooting stars each hour, if that hour has a clear sky. These are more common, occurring on average 5-10 nights per month. 

Both heavy and light meteor showers are locked to the date on which they occur, and will always occur on that date even if you time travel. 

### How do I wish on a star, and what does it do?
To wish on a star: when you see or hear it moving across the sky, stand still, look up with your right joystick, and press the “A” button. Make sure you are not holding any tools or other items in your hands. You’ll know that it worked if you hear a tone and see the star glow a little brighter. For each star you wish on, you will find a star fragment on your beach the following day.

Star fragments are a crafting material that can be used in DIY recipes.

### What's the max amount of star fragments I can get?
1 wish = 1 star fragment. You can also visit other players who have shooting stars and wish on their islands; wishes made on someone else's island will count as personal wishes.

By yourself, you can obtain a maximum of 20 star fragments. If you invite visitors from other islands (**not** other residents that live on your island), you can obtain up to 40 star fragments. For every 5 wishes your visitors make, you will receive 1 additional star fragment on top of the amount you wished for yourself. This means your visitors need to wish 100 times total for you to achieve the additional 20, for a max total of 40 fragments.

### Can I visit other islands for shooting stars and/or Celeste?
Yes! You can wish on shooting stars while visiting another player’s island and the star fragments will appear on your island’s beach the next day. Just like on your own island, each wish you make on another island counts for one star fragment, to a maximum of 20 wishes. Any zodiac fragments you receive will correspond to the date on your island and not the date of the host island. By extension if you had wished on stars on the last zodiac day on your island (or someone else's island), the star fragments you find on the beach the next day will be from the zodiac corresponding to the day you wished.

However, if you visit Celeste on another player’s island, any zodiac DIY you receive will correspond to the date of the host island.  

### I didn’t get all my star fragments the next day! What gives?
Star fragments spawn periodically throughout the day, usually 8-10 at a time. If the next set doesn’t appear after a little while, clear your beaches of shells and other items that may block the spawns and wait a little while longer. 

**Star Fragment Drop Rates From Wishing**

  - 70% star fragment

<!-- TODO: Ninji's website is out of date, either use Ahri's (which is out of date but less so), or find another resource -->
### What are the different mystery islands and what can I find on them?
Please visit https://wuffs.org/acnh/mysterytour.html for a complete list of them.  
Additionally, there is a 30% chance of finding fossil, as well as a 30% chance of finding a DIY message bottle per island. You can always find one wasp's nest and a piece of furniture from shaking a non-fruit tree. If you have an empty, unsold plot, you can also find a random villager. See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16yHQzdYx4VznhnKSGZdtaKi_Yo8NpDwCYK8dmpR481s/edit) to learn about how the game determines the villager. See [here](https://acnhapi.com/nmt-calculator/) for figuring out your chances of finding a specific villager.

### How do I dream?
Go to a bed indoors and lie down. Select "I want to sleep." This will allow you to enter the dream world and meet Luna! From there, select "I want to dream" and then enter a dream address!  

### How do I get my dream address?
Go to a bed indoors and lie down. Select "I want to sleep." From there you will meet Luna! Select "Share a dream" to receive your dream code.  
Your weather and time in the dream will be same as when you upload the dream.

### What can you do in a dream?
You can explore other user's islands at your own leisure to get inspiration or talk to different villagers! Any changes made by visitors will NOT affect your real island and visitors can NOT take anything from a dream!  

### How can I find X seasonal material?
- See [here](https://bigfootmg.github.io/ACNH-Plant-Guide/07.png) for young spring bamboo, cherry blossom, acorns, pine cones, maple leaves, and mushrooms.  
- Summer shells are found on the beach and more spawn every five minutes.
- Snowflakes flow around you island and can be caught with a net.
- Ornaments drop from decorated cedar trees. They will only appear after Isabelle announces their presence. See [here](/time-travel#i-time-traveled-to-festive-season-but-why-are-none-of-the-cedar-trees-decorated) for how to get them. 
- Note for acorns, pinecones and ornaments: you can simply shake one tree infinitely until it produces the amount you want.
