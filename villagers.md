## Villagers
### Who are villagers?
The AC community commonly refers to animal island residents as 'villagers'.

### How many villagers are there in Animal Crossing: New Horizons?
Currently there are 391 villagers in AC:NH. See [here](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Villagers/New_Horizons) for a list of them.

### How many villagers can I have?
You can have 10 animal villagers and up to 8 human villagers. You can only have one animal villager with same name on the same island.
 
### How do I get a specific villager?
Unfortunately there’s no 100% guaranteed way to get a specific villager unless you have their Amiibo card or adopt them from someone else’s island. Your other options are to use NMT to find them on mystery islands, or hope they visit your campsite!

### How do I make a villager move out?
Please refer to Yue’s move-out guide here: https://yuexr.github.io/acnh/moveout.html.

### I agreed to let one of my villagers move out today, when can I go looking for a new villager?
For a timeline of the move-out sequence, visit https://yuexr.github.io/img/mo/2.png.
You MUST have an unsold, empty plot available to invite a villager from another player's island, or to find villagers on mystery islands (and you can only invite *one villager from a mystery island* per day). Note: If someone visited and claimed your villager who was in boxes their house will immediately say 'I moved out', but you will still need to wait until the next day for an empty plot.

### How do I invite a villager from another player's island?
The villager has to be moving out and 'in boxes', if you talk to them they will mention that they are moving out and you'll be shown an option to invite them to live on your island. If you have an open plot, they will mention that they spoke to Tom Nook and are going to move in to your island and show up on your island the next day.

### How do I extend the time window my villager is in boxes (or) How do I extend the duration my plot is empty?
[Time travel](/time-travel) a few hours backwards, but stay within the same day.

### Will my villagers move out without telling me?
No. They always need to ask you for your permission before they move out. You need to have at least six villagers, for villagers to start asking about moving out.

### Can my most recently moved-in villager ask to move out?
No. It is 100% impossible for them to request to move out.

### Is there any other way to move out my most recently moved-in villager?
Yes, campsite visitors (both naturally spawning and [Amiibo](#what-are-amiibos-who-has-an-amiibo) scanned campers) can kick out your newest. 

### Does talking to a villager until they get the purple squiggly/reporting the villager to Isabelle make them more likely to ask to move out?
No. Anyone claiming that these methods increase the likelihood of villagers asking to move out have been misinformed.

### Does hitting a villager/pushing a villager until they're angry make them more likely to ask to move out?
This is a bit more complex, as it relates to [friendship](#what-is-friendshipwhat-are-friendship-levels). Making a villager angry by hitting or pushing them can lower friendship points, but not friendship levels. This can make them slightly more likely to ask to move out (provided the target villager isn't at the level threshold already), but it doesn't always have a significant effect on ask chance. That said, claiming that hitting/pushing has no effect on villagers (or has the opposite effect of making them want to stay) is false.  

### How do I trade a villager to another player?
Receiving player: Must have an empty, unsold plot. (Note: This cannot be plot 3-6 if the player is in the beginning stages of the game.)

Giving player: Must have the villager of interest in boxes moving *out*. ("In boxes" refers to the day after the villager asks to move out of the island, when their belongings are packed up in cardboard boxes in their home.)

The receiving player visits the giving player's island and speaks to the villager of interest twice, which will prompt the "You should move in" dialogue option. After the villager has spoken to the receiving player's Resident Services, the receiving player's empty plot should say SOLD with the villager's name on it.

Note that villager-for-villager trades happen in the same way, but require both players have an extra empty plot to purchase or require [time travel](/time-travel). 

### How often does someone visit my campsite?
Campsite visitors are determined on a percent chance roll, where the chance is based on when your last campsite visitor was. 

| Days Since Last Campsite Visitor | Chance of Campsite Visitor |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1-2                              | 0%                         |
| 3                                | 5%                         |
| 4                                | 10%                        |
| 5                                | 15%                        |
| 6+                               | 20%                        |

Meaning for every day starting the 6th day after your last campsite visitor, there is a 20% chance another campsite visitor will appear. Note that campsite visitors are not date-based, so time traveling to a date that you previously had a camper will not work to spawn another one. Also you **can't** get a camper from someone else's campsite. For more information on campsite see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c8rsKWWtwsOo_JOxwO-lVRx2MUhc-bcdZg1mhXgtRPg/edit).

### Can I chose who the camper replace?
For "normal" campers, no, but you can reset who they chose. Visit https://yuexr.github.io/img/mo/4.png for more detail. [Amiibo](#how-do-i-invite-a-villager-to-live-on-my-island-using-their-amiibo) campers allow you to choose who they replace.

### What are the villager personalities?
There are 8 villager personalities.

| Male   | Female        |
|--------|---------------|
| Smug   | Normal/Sweet  |
| Jock   | Uchi/Sisterly |
| Cranky | Snooty        |
| Lazy   | Peppy         |

Special NPCs do not have personalities, and each villager can only be of one personality. Personality dictates the DIYs a villager crafts, the reactions they teach, and the dialogue they can use.

### Do I *need* to have all 8 personalities on my island?
No, you don't. There are some benefits to having all 8 personalities, such as unlocking all of the [reactions](#what-are-reactions) as well as easily getting all the villager-crafted DIYs. The game also encourages personality diversity by personality-locking your first 6 villagers:
- Villagers 1 and 2 are Jock and Uchi
- Villagers 3-5 are Peppy, Normal, and Lazy
- Villager 6 is Smug

That said, there's no requirement to do this, and you should have the villagers on your island that you enjoy the most! 

### What is friendship/What are friendship levels?
“Friendship” refers to how close you are with your villagers. Talking to them, gifting them items, and completing quests for them all increases friendship. Villagers also have friendship levels, and when you unlock new levels, you unlock new interactions and quests! For more specific details, visit Yue’s friendship guide, located here: https://yuexr.github.io/acnh/friendship.html.

### What are reactions? 
Each villager personality allows you to unlock reactions—these are the emotion animations your character can display. Unlocking them all takes time, so be patient! The table below shows which reactions are unlocked based on which personalities. You need a villager of that personality living on your island to unlock those specific reactions.

For example, if you have no peppy villager, you cannot learn the aggravation, curiosity, happiness, sleepy, or mischief reactions. You can, however, always move out a villager once you’ve obtained all of their possible reactions!

For the Halloween reactions, they are earned by playing the [Halloween](/events#halloween) event. The Hip Reactions Collection can be bought via Nook Miles Redemption for 2,700 Nook Miles.

All reactions and their sources: 

| Type                       | Reactions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Special                                                |

### What are Amiibos? Who has an Amiibo? 
Amiibos are Nintendo-produced collectibles that come in the form of cards or figurines and allow players to unlock special features when scanned into games. You can buy them from some online retailers or secondhand. In Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Amiibos allow you to invite villagers onto your island or unlock posters, an in-game item. There are 456 Animal Crossing Amiibo cards, including non-villager NPCs, villagers, and special villagers (such as the Sanrio x Animal Crossing villagers). 

All villagers have Amiibo cards **except** the following: Raymond, Dom, Sherb, Cyd, Reneigh, Audie, Judy, and Megan. (These 8 were introduced into the franchise in New Horizons, and thus do not have Amiibo cards or figures.) The NPCs Wilbur, Orville, Harvey, Lloid, Flick, C.J., Daisy Mae, Gullivarrr, and Wisp also have no Amiibos. 

***Note:** Amiibo villagers are in no way different from NMT island villagers. They are the exact same.*

### Where can I purchase Amiibo figures/cards?
Amiibos can be purchased at authorized Nintendo retailers in your local area. You may also be able to find them secondhand on websites like eBay or Amazon.

### What about Amiibo chips/NFC cards/unofficial Amiibos?
Unofficial Amiibos can be made using a method called "spoofing". These Amiibos are not official nor guaranteed to work, but are an option if you cannot find official Amiibos near you.

### How do I invite a villager to live on my island using their Amiibo?
Once you unlock the campsite (see [here](/unlocking-things#building-unlocks) on how to unlock it), visit Resident Services and interact with the Nook Stop. On the initial menu, the option to “Invite \[Amiibo\] Camper" should appear. Select it and touch your Amiibo card to your right joystick. Your villager will appear in your campsite as soon as you close out of the Nook Stop. 

After you speak to them in the campsite, the villager will ask you to craft an item for them, occasionally teaching you a new DIY in the process. Repeat this process 3 times (invite camper, craft requested item) will allow you to ask them to move in on their third visit! The 3 days need not be consecutive. You can also juggle up to 8 in-progress amiibo scan-ins at a time; that is, if you scan in a 9th amiibo villager without completing the previous quests, the game will begin to delete its memory of the earlier camper visits.

### I traded one of my first five villagers with a 'basic' house layout, will they have a proper/default layout on the new island?
Yes. Additionally, any furniture, fish/bug you gifted them and **is on their floor** will be reset when they move to a new island.

### Is there any gameplay related benefit to gifting villagers?
Yes, it increases your [friendship level](#what-is-friendshipwhat-are-friendship-levels) with them. For more info on gifting, please refer to Yue's gifting guide here - https://yuexr.github.io/acnh/gift.html.

**Sub-Notes:**  
<sup>1</sup>: *Wall-mounted furniture is not safe even though it's not visibly displayed, because enough of it will overload a villager's inventory to the point where they will start removing wall-mounted furniture and surface furniture.*  
<sup>2</sup>: *Birthday-gifted/mailed shoes don't get physically placed but go directly to their wardrobe.*  
<sup>3</sup>: *Birthday-gifted/mailed rugs don't get physically placed but are stored in their inventory.*  
<sup>4</sup>: *Although you can't hand-gift vaulting pole, ladder, villager photos, or posters, mailing these will actually cause them to get added to their inventory.*

### If I complete X quest for my villager, will they keep that item in their inventory?
It depends on the type of quest and friendship levels! These are the storing rules for quests:
- Buy/Trade an item from your pockets: Always stored
- Appreciation or Apology Gift: Always stored
- Wrongly Delivered Item Return 
  - Friendship level 1-2: Always stored
  - Friendship level 3-4: Stored 70% of the time
  - Friendship level 5-6: Never stored
- Left Item Return
  - Friendship level 1-2: Always stored
  - Friendship level 3-4: Stored 70% of the time
  - Friendship level 5-6: Never stored
- Borrowed Item Return: Never stored
- Catch Request: Never stored

***Note:** If you are asked to deliver a present, but you open said present before delivering it, the item will never be stored by the recipient.*

### My villager wears clothing I gifted them, how do I reset it?
- Villagers' gifted clothing can be removed via giving them over 24 wearable clothing items, as 24 is the limit for clothing a villager can hold.
- Accessories can be replaced by gifting them 24 *non-glasses* accessories (e.g. bubblegum). 
- Hats (no helmets): in the game exist two tags for hats, free and womanly. Male villagers will only use hats tagged as free and gifting them 24 womanly hats will replace other hats from their storage. Since female villagers can use both types of hats, the only way to remove them is when they approach you to sell/gift/trade the item. For information on clothing tags, visit https://bit.ly/3gWAJDe.
- If you wish to remove a custom design, please read [here](/npc-visitors-and-special-characters#isabelle).
- Note: Villagers may place any gifted item (including tops) in their homes as mannequins in their house.

### My villager placed a furniture item (or a mannequin of a clothing) I gifted them in their house, how do I remove it?
You cannot remove the furniture/mannequin, but you can replace it using this guide https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Iql5J5BXG-SuJvtw_duLZzjIw5myGcFnEL-I3BSR_CE/edit?usp=sharing. Replacing mannequins forces the clothing item (if wearable) to go into the villager's clothing inventory and thus be able to wear it.

### What is the difference between 'gifted' and 'ungifted' villagers during trading, and why is it important to inform someone you are trading with know?
- Gifted villagers have been given gifts or wear custom designs displayed on Able's back wall. They tend to be less desirable to other players in comparison to ungifted villagers. They can never be ungifted, only have their gifts replaced.
- Ungifted villagers tend to be *higher value*, completely default villagers — they only wear their original outfits and have an untouched house—as if they were found from a mystery island.

### What is the void?/Where do villagers that automatically fill my empty plots come from?
Every player has two "voids": a Move In Queue (MIQ) and a Move Out Queue (MOQ).
- The MIQ holds 4 villagers that came from other players' MOQ that were transferred when you played online with them. When your empty plot autofills, this is where game pulls those villagers from! They can stay in there indefinitely.
- The MOQ is what is commonly referred to as "the void". It is an invisible space where villagers who move out, but are not adopted, go to live (also indefinitely) until they can be passed into another player's MIQ. The MOQ holds up to 10 villagers.

### When does X villager wake up/go to bed?
- **Lazy:** 8:00 AM – 11:00 PM  
- **Jock:** 6:30 AM – 12:30 AM  
- **Cranky:** 9:00 AM – 3:30 AM  
- **Smug:** 7:00 AM – 2:00 AM  
- **Normal:** 6:00 AM – 12:00 AM  
- **Peppy:** 7:00 AM – 1:30 AM  
- **Snooty:** 8:30 AM – 2:30 AM  
- **Sisterly:** 9:30 AM – 3 AM  
- ***Note:** Villagers also have the ability to wake up early or pull all-nighters.*
