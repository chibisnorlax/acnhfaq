## Bug-Off
In the Northern Hemisphere, the Bug-Off occurs on the 4th Saturday of June, July, August, and September from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. In the Southern Hemisphere, it occurs on the 3rd Saturday of November, December, January, and February from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. 

To participate, talk to Flick and pay 500 bells. Each round lasts 3 minutes—the goal is to catch as many bugs as possible in order to earn points. The points you earn in total (across all Bug-Offs) amass to a certain trophy—bronze for 100 points, silver for 200 points, and gold for 300 points. These trophies can only be earned once per player. 

The points can also be used to redeem items, of which there are 13. Once you have collected all 13, you will start to receive duplicates. Redeeming points for items (10 points each) does not detract from the trophy total.  

Each bug you catch adds 1 point to your total and each bug after the first three adds a bonus 2 points. The bugs you catch will immediately appear in Flick’s bug cage. He will also buy them from you for 1.5x the regular selling price. If you play with others, you will receive bonus points and waive the 500 bell fee.

The fishing tourney occurs on the 2nd weekend of April, July, October, and January from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. The dates do not vary across hemispheres. 

To participate, talk to C.J. and pay 500 bells. Each round lasts 3 minutes—the goal is to catch as many fish as possible in order to earn points. The points you earn in total (cumulative across all Fishing Tourneys in any island) amass to a certain trophy—bronze for 100 points, silver for 200 points, and gold for 300 points. These trophies can only be earned once per player. 

The points can also be used to redeem items, of which there are 13. Once you have collected all 13, you will start to receive duplicates. Redeeming points for items (10 points each) does not detract from the trophy total.  

Each fish you catch adds 1 point to your total and each fish after the first three adds a bonus 2 points. The fish you catch will immediately appear in C.J.’s cooler box. He will also buy them from you for 1.5x the regular selling price. If you play with others, you will receive bonus points and waive the 500 bell fee.

## Bunny Day (Easter)
Bunny Day starts on April 1st and ends on April 12th. If it is the first time you’re doing this event, Zipper will come to your island and give you a Bunny Day bed recipe. During the event, villagers will come up to you to teach you the Bunny Day crown and bag recipe. Egg-theme clothing such as, the stone egg hat and outfit, is self taught after you collect a certain amount of that kind of egg. When you learned all of them, you'll learn the egg party dress and hat. You can get the other recipes from Bunny Day message bottles and balloons. 
 
Different eggs are required to make the DIYs. There are six different types of eggs. They are the following:

| Type      | How to Obtain                                                               |

| Water Egg | Randomly caught while fishing in rivers, ponds, and the sea.                |
| Stone Egg | Randomly dropped when hitting rocks with a shovel or an axe.                |
| Wood Egg  | Randomly dropped when hitting trees with an axe.                            |
| Earth Egg | Dug up from the ground, marked with a star, like fossils.                   |

On the last day of Bunny Day, Zipper will come to your island and give you the Bunny Day Arch recipe. If you crafted all of the Bunny Day recipes, talk to Zipper again to get the Wobbling Zipper Toy DIY. After you craft the toy, you can talk to Zipper to receive the Bunny Day Wand recipe.

## Halloween 
Halloween happens on October 31st from 5:00 PM to 12:00 AM. The "Czar of Halloween", Jack, will pay a visit to your island. Jack will give you his outfit in exchange for candies. If you give him lollipops, he’ll give you the Spooky Carriage and Spooky Wand recipe. You can also give candy to villagers that are outside to get furniture and recipes from the spooky set and lollipops. Villagers will teach you the scare reaction after you give them a piece of candy and likewise, Jack will teach you the haunt reaction. If you don’t have candy when a villager comes up to you, they will give three pieces of candy the first time. But everytime after that or if you don’t give them candy, they will change your bodypaint, eye contact color, and face paint, called a "trick". You can get more candy from villagers that are inside of their house by talking to them while wearing a scary costume. If you wear Jack’s outfits while talking to villagers, they will also give you candy. It doesn’t matter if they are outside or inside, but you can only do this once per villager.
